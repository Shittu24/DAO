# DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS EXCHANGE (DAO) For Crypto Devs WITH LEARNWEB3DAO SOPHOMORE TRACK

This project demonstrates a DAO where all our NFT holders can participate in decision making. From the ETH that was gained through the ICO, we build a DAO Treasury. The DAO now has a lot of ETH, but currently does nothing with it.

We want all our NFT holders to create and vote on proposals to use that ETH for purchasing other NFTs from an NFT marketplace, and speculate on price. Maybe in the future when we sell the NFTs, we split the profits among all members of the DAO.
